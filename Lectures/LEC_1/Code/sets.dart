/**
 * Sets in Dart is a special case in List where all the inputs are unique 
 * i.e it doesnâ€™t contain any repeated input. 
 * It can also be interpreted as an unordered array with unique inputs. 
 * The set comes in play when we want to store unique values in a single variable
 * without considering the order of the inputs. 
 * The sets are declared by the use of a set keyword.
